# CSCI 121: Computer Science II
## Linked List Lab

**Question 1: ** I would test to make sure that: 
getName (any index) gets null
getQuantity (any index) gets -1
getLength gets 0
isMember gets false

**Question 2: ** I would insert a new node and then test to make sure that :
getName(0) gets the name of your node
getQuantity(0) gets the quantity of your node
getLength() gets 1
isMember(name of your node) gets true

**Question 4: ** Yes

**Question 5: ** It should be a node with a quantity greater than that of the initial node.

**Question 6: ** It should have a quantity between the other two nodes'.

**Question 7: ** I think so, it seems like at this point we've covered every possible method of insertion 
and run successful tests on all elements of those insertions.

**Question 8: ** I learned that the linkedList methods have a lot more exceptions to catch than I initially 
realized.
